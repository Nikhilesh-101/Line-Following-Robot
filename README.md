# Line-Following-Robot
The line follower robot is a mobile machine that can detect and follow the line drawn on the floor. Generally, the path is predefined and can be either visible like a black line on a white surface with a high contrasted color or it can be invisible like a magnetic filed.

A line-following robot kit typically includes all the necessary components to build a robot that can autonomously follow a path, usually marked by a black or white line on a contrasting surface. Below are the main components and details you can expect in a typical kit:

1. Chassis
Description: The body of the robot where all components are mounted.
Material: Commonly made of plastic or acrylic, lightweight but sturdy enough to hold the components.
2. Motors and Wheels
DC Motors: Usually two DC motors (in most basic kits), sometimes geared, to drive the wheels.
Wheels: Two wheels for movement, and an optional caster wheel for balance.
3. Sensors
Infrared (IR) Sensors: These sensors detect the line on the ground. Typically, two or more IR sensors are placed at the front of the robot.
Working: IR sensors detect differences in color (black or white) or reflectivity of the surface to follow the line.
Ultrasonic Sensor (Optional): Sometimes included for obstacle detection in more advanced kits.
4. Arduino 
Arduino UNO Board: An Arduino board (like Arduino Uno or Nano) or another microcontroller is used to control the robot. Some kits might use custom boards.
Pre-programmed or Programmable: Some kits come pre-programmed, while others allow you to write your own code for controlling the motors and sensors.
5. Motor Driver
L298N Motor Driver: A motor driver like the L298N is often used to control the speed and direction of the motors based on the input from the sensors.
6. Power Supply
Battery Holder: Generally a battery pack that holds AA batteries or a rechargeable Li-ion battery.
Voltage: Typically requires 6-12V depending on the motors and microcontroller.
7. Wires and Connectors
Jumper Wires: For connecting various components like sensors, motor drivers, and the microcontroller.
Connectors: Plug-and-play connectors for easy assembly.
8. Optional Components
Bluetooth Module (HC-05/HC-06): For wireless control.
LED Indicators: For status updates, often for debugging.
Buzzer: To provide audio feedback or alarms.
Programming
Arduino IDE (if using Arduino): Most kits use Arduino, where you write the program in C/C++ using the Arduino IDE.
Logic: The sensors detect the path, and the program adjusts the motors to keep the robot following the line.
Assembly and Instructions
Kits often come with a manual or instructions that guide you through the assembly process, including wiring and programming. Many also provide sample code.
